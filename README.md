***If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?***

In terms of backend language, I tend to use Ruby on Rails. I do wish that there were more updated documentation for its usage. It is definitely a trial and error when it comes to utilizing it with other frontend frameworks as well. I do plan on providing more documentation as I go along in my coding journey so that I can contribute to our open source community.
